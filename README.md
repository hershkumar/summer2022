### Summer 2022 Research
Research on Variational Monte Carlo using Neural Networks

### vmc_one_param.ipynb
Variational Monte Carlo with 1 parameter. Uses sympy's symbolic differentiation for the vmc.
### vmc_generalized.ipynb
Variational Monte Carlo with an arbitrary number of parameters. Uses sympy's symbolic differentiation.
### auto_vmc.ipynb
Variational Monte Carlo with an arbitrary number of parameters, using jax's autodifferentiation instead of symbolic differentiation.
### many_particle_vmc.ipynb
Many particle potential VMC for an arbitrary number of parameters. Uses jax's autodifferentiation.

### one_particle_harmonic_well.ipynb
Single particle neural network ansatz using jax.

### n-particle-harmonic-well.ipynb
$n$ particles in harmonic well potential, using neural network ansatz. Also implements variable sampling.
